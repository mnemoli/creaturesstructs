# Creatures Structs

[Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) formats for the Creatures games.

You can use the [Kaitai Web IDE](https://ide.kaitai.io/) to try these files for yourself.

Example files from the Creatures games are included in this repo.

### Creatures 1 EXP

Currently focuses on extracting the CBrain contents, with only minimal parsing of other sections.

Developed using the [CDR EXP File Format](http://double.nz/creatures/creatures2/expbrain.htm) page.

The .ksy in this repo covers more than the CDR page (e.g. the state rule bytes).
